the properties of an effective bait formulation

* slow acting,long lasting

In cockroaches control, baits have been used with a variety of toxicants, including traditional insecticides such as

Pesticide baits are now a common method of managing a variety of insect and vertebrate pests.  What are the properties of an effective bait formulation?  Include in your answer characteristics of the active ingredient, bait base, and bait container or delivery system.  Use at least two examples to illustrate the use of baits in urban pest management.
  
### 2.  Briefly compare and contrast the identification, biology, and habits of the following:

#### Pharaoh ant and thief ant

ID: color and size are similar, but can be differentiate by antennae.
Pharaoh ant: antennae are 12 segmented with a three-segmented club.                            
thief ant:  antennae are 10 segmented with a two-segmented club. 

Biology and habits:
Both are polygyne,omivores. Pharaoh can splinter a colony into numerous satelite colonies. Confronted with carbonhydrates and protein, Pharaoh ant colonies prefer the one they have not been feeding on. Thief ant colonies are attracted to grease.
             

#### Drywood termite and subterranean termite
ID : winged reproductive: subterranean termites have two dark thick veins; Drywood termite have three or four dark thick veins

Biology and habit: subterranean termite nest in ground and travel from ground to structures. Drywood termite
 nest inside the wood they infest, don't require soil contact and require much less moisture than subterranean termite.

#### European hornet and carpenter bee

ID: European hornet( family : Vespidae) is thiner than carpenter bee (family: Apoidea).

Biology and habit: Carpenter bees are traditionally considered solitary bees, and European hornet is social.

#### Formosan subterranean termite and Eastern subterranean termite

ID: Formosan termite soldiers have egg-shaped heads compared to the more rectangular head of subterranean termites. Formosan termite soldiers are more aggressive than native subterranean termite soldiers and, when disturbed, exude a  defensive secretion from the fontanelle.

Biology and habit: Formosan colonies are far more larger compared to Eastern subterranean termite and have larger foraging diameter. they can destroy non-wood materials. Colony growth is fast but for Eastern subterranean termite, it may take years before swarmers are produced.

#### Argentine ant and red imported fire ant

ID: Argentine ant worker ：the antennae of is 12-segmented without a club. the body varies in color from light to dark brown. Red imported ant worker：the antennae is 10 segmented with two-segmented club. the clypeus has three teeth. the body color is an almost uniform dard reddish-brown.

Biology and habit: Argentine ant can not sting. A colony typically consists of 10% queens and 90% workers. RIFA have two forms: monogyne or polygyne. the latter are larger and have higher mound density.

Poria incrassata :: the wood-decaying fungus of houses

Adsorption :: fumigant molecules stick to the surface of a material (commodity, soil or other item being fumigated).

Monodomous :: an individual has only one spouse during their lifetime

Pseudergate :: a larval form functionally equivalent to the worker caste in termite, but remains able to develop into presodier.

Thief ant :: Solenopsis molesta, get their names from the habit of nesting near other ant nests, from which they steal food.

Temporal polyethism :: castes are based on temporary periods of highly specialized work, it is not physical but physiological changes of individual are required.

Nymphoid :: individuals developing from nymphs through the standard hemimetabolous pathway to adulthood

Powderpost beetles (Lyctidae) :: the larvae of these beetles feed on wood and can reduce it to fine powder.

#### Biological approaches

1. Entomopathogenic Nematodes
2. Pathogenic fungi
3. Termite resistant wood

2. Postconstucion treatment 

* Treatment along construction
* Treatment under slabs 
* Vertical Drilling/Teatment 
* Horizonal Drilling/Teatment Basement Treatment

##### Wood treatment with liquid termiticides
Wood can also be treated for termites as preventive measure or to eliminate existing infestations.
##### Termite Baits

### B.  Ants are trailing into your kitchen wastebasket, and you are NOT happy!  Outline the steps you will take to control this pest.

1. clean the wastebasket and the trail,find the source according to the trail and pour boiling water to the ant nest to kill them.

3. classify the waste and put the food waste in special bag and throw it to the trash can regularly.

4. clean the area around the house, such as bush, grass

5. if all the above are done and there are still ants. use pesticides to control, such as baits.Urban Entomology Exam III
