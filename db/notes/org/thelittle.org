* Always ask "null?" as the first question in expressing any function
* Use cons to build lists.
* When building a list, describe the first typical element, and then cons it onto the natural recursion.
* car 
The primitive car is defined only for non-empty list.
* cdr
The primitive cdr is defined only for non-empty lists. The cdr of any non-empty list is always another list.
* cons
cons adds any s-expression to the front of a list.
The primitive cons takes two arguments. The second argument to cons must
be a list. The result is a list.
* null?

the primitive null? is defined only for list.
* eq?
it takes two arguments. Both of them
must be non-numeric atoms.
