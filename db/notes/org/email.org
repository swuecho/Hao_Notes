
Update on my progress

Because the experiment I take will take rather long time, I have to care much about the experiment design.
 As a result, most of my time are spent on the statistics. After a hard time learning, I have the overall 
picture of the experiment design. My research will be composed of two part.

+ the instar determination
+ temperature-dependent develpment

Both of them are very basic, but far from easy. It is not the time and labor that make them difficult, but 
the mathematics model. For example, in the instar determination, Dyar's law is easy to follow, but the distribution model
is not the case. It is beyond undergraduat level, but I think I am in the right way to study them.

So far, I only have a overall pictures, but I will start to write the formal proposal in the next month. I will
try to finish it before the end of October. Hopefully, I will begin the experiment in November. 

PS: the research methods in different species are very simiar or evern identical. Since the life cycle of Shellfordlla lateris
is short than Blapica dupia. I will focus on the dupia in the first stage. 







Update on my progress

Dr. Hu and I have been discussing several possible projects 
that you could start that would make excellent topics for a thesis. 
One project is to develop a complete life history and temperature-development
 relationship for one or two cockroach species of economic importance. 
In particular, the Guiana orange spotted cockroach, Blaptica dubia. 
Although they are not considered pests, they are very important as "feeder species" for those that keep 
pet lizards, turtles, spiders, and other predacious animals. 
I think this project could be very useful and would demonstrate your 
abilities to rear insects, determine instars, measure stadia, measure 
fecundity and longevity, develop a degree-day model, and examine various 
aspects of maternal behavior, courtship, aggregation, and other aspects of 
cockroach biology. I also think that these studies would make excellent 
publications in the scientific literature.  Do you have comments or suggestions?


Thank you for your email. I think the Blaptica dubia is a good species to study. When I was searching for materials 
in the internet one year ago, most of the information is provided by the pet lovers. There was few scientific research 
about it. This research would be of great use.

we have this species in our lab. After I bought it, I only raise it for one month and other take over it.
Actually, I am not raising the cockroaches in Dr. Wang 's lab now. I just go there when I am free and check if 
everthing goes well. The Blaptica dubia is the easiest to rear I think. This is also one of the factors
which make them a good "feeder species".

As to the project, The difficulty is to determine instars and mearuse stadia. It is very hard to be accurate. 
There are some papers about the life history of  Periplaneta fuliginosa , I doubt its accuracy after I raise 
them myself.
For maternal behavior, I don't believe the species is the proper one. Maybe the species of Cryptocercus 
are better. 

The program would last at least one year due to the longevity of this species. If I were to do this program,
I would like to study two or more species, because the program last long, but it only takes few time 
everyday. The 
species _Shelfordella lateralis_ (Turkish cockroaches) is also "feeder species". It is also distribuated in US and has better 
fecundity. I am willing to take some Ootheca with me if necessary.

I would like to start the program as soon as possible if I were to do the program, or I may not complete in time.
When I am there, I am not familar with the lab in the beginning, this program is suitable 
for me. While I get farmiliar and have few classes, I would like to do other program with 
others or learn new skills to prepare my PhD study. Besides, I still want to know the other proram 
available. I would like to make the final decision with both of you after my arrival. It will be better when I know
the equipment and other resourses available in the lab.

I am sorry for my delay in updating travel plans.I have recieved my visa and I will arrive with Feng Liu
 at Atlanta in 13:35 July 28. We have registered the school shuttle.
the shutlle would send us to auburn.

Dear Prof. Hu,

I went to Dr. Ding's tabacoo experimental station and collected some insects. 
There are belong to the group of insects we are looking for, but I am not sure they are the very species.
My plan is to take all the similar ones (about 20) with me. I will return to my hometown in next month and will find more.
The question is how I can take them without being discovered by the custom. We are using them to do scientific research, 
but the custom might not believe.

With best wishes,

Hao Wu
