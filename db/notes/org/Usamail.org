Dear Prof. Hu,

I have arrived at Auburn University just now. I take the specimens along with me. Maybe only one is 
the species we are looking for. I am sorry for not geting  more specimens. I am planning to go to your 
office tommorrow morning. If you will not be there tommorrow, could you tell me how to keep them by myself?

With best wishes,

Hao Wu
