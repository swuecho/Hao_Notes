Abstract: Different tillage practices affect the feature and 
structure of soil and have indirect influence on the occurrence of orange
 wheat blossom wheat midges Sitodiplosis mosellana (Gehin). 
Surveys of wheat midges including counting the larvae in soil,
 net-trapping and stripping glumes of ears were conducted in the wheat 
fields of different tillage practices in Luancheng agroecosystem experimental 
station of Chinese Academy of Science in Hebei province. 
The results were that the average numbers of larvae in soil samples 
of different treatments was in the following order: 
straw mulch and no-tillage（SMNT）> Straw standing and no-tillage（SSNT）>
 Straw mulch and rotary tillage（SRRT） in 2010 and 2011, but the average
 numbers of larvae of per 100 tillers by stripping glumes was in 
the reverse order of soil samples. : SRRT > SSNT > SMNT.
Analysis showed that fields of no tillage practices would
 be beneficial to the larvae’s over-wintering, 
but wheat paddy with this treatment got less damage in the ears.
 Fields of rotary tillage practices would be harmful to the larvae’s 
over-wintering but wheat paddy with this treatment got much more damages in the ears.
 For the fields of similar tillage, 
flood irrigation could cause more serious occurrences of wheat midges.
