Dear Helen,

I get the jobs description from Perl Jobs websites. I did not know Giant 
street also have positions for Perl Interns. Also, I know the skills listed in the job descriptions, I have to admit I am not in expert level.

I wish I can be a offical employee of Giant Street. However, I can start form an intern. I will graduate before August.  Could you inform the HR about that before we have the phone interview at 2:00 pm, Apr 22. Thanks.

Have a nice weekend!

Hao Wu
